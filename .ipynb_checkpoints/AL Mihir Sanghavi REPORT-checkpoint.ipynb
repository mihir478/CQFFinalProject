    "# Algorithmic Trading Strategies: Part I Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on implementing and backtesting two core algorithmic trading strategies using high-frequency data obtained through the Alpaca Markets API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend-Following Strategy**: Designed to capitalize on sustained market trends.\n",
    "2. **Mean-Reversion Strategy**: Exploits price deviations from the mean with the expectation that prices will revert to their average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation emphasizes utilizing intraday data (e.g., 15-minute intervals), evaluating the mathematical nuances of indicators, and conducting a thorough analysis of strategy performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trend-Following Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicators Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:\n",
    "   - The EMA is a weighted average of prices where recent prices are given more weight.\n",
    "   - Formulation:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     EMA_t = \\alpha \\cdot P_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot EMA_{t-1}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ P_t $: Current price\n",
    "     - $ \\alpha $: Smoothing factor, $ \\alpha = \\frac{2}{n + 1} $, and $ n $ is the number of periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Directional Index (ADX)**:\n",
    "   - Measures trend strength and is used to filter weak trends.\n",
    "   - Combines directional indicators $ +DI $ and $ -DI $:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     ADX = 100 \\cdot \\frac{EMA(\\text{True Range})}{\\text{ATR}}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Directional Indicators (+DI and -DI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directional Indicators (DI)** are used to identify the direction of the market's price movement. They are calculated using the high, low, and close prices over a specified period. There are two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**+DI (Positive Directional Indicator)**:\n",
    "   - Measures the strength of upward movement.\n",
    "   - It is calculated based on the difference between the current high price and the previous high price:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     +DI = \\frac{+DM}{\\text{ATR}} \\times 100\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ +DM $ (Positive Directional Movement) = Current High - Previous High (only if positive; otherwise, it is 0).\n",
    "     - **ATR (Average True Range)**: Used to normalize the directional movement values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**-DI (Negative Directional Indicator)**:\n",
    "   - Measures the strength of downward movement.\n",
    "   - It is calculated based on the difference between the current low price and the previous low price:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     -DI = \\frac{-DM}{\\text{ATR}} \\times 100\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ -DM $ (Negative Directional Movement) = Previous Low - Current Low (only if positive; otherwise, it is 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Average True Range (ATR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ATR** measures market volatility by calculating the average range of price movements over a specified period. It accounts for gaps in the price and provides a smoothed measure of volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Formula for True Range (TR):**\n",
    "$\n",
    "TR = \\text{max}(\\text{High} - \\text{Low}, |\\text{High} - \\text{Previous Close}|, |\\text{Low} - \\text{Previous Close}|)\n",
    "$\n",
    "- **High - Low**: The range within the current period.\n",
    "- **|High - Previous Close|**: The (absolute valued) gap between the current high and the previous close. \n",
    "- **|Low - Previous Close|**: The (absolute valued) gap between the current low and the previous close.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Formula for ATR:**\n",
    "The ATR is a moving average of the True Range (TR) over a defined number of periods (e.g., 14):\n",
    "$\n",
    "ATR = \\frac{\\text{Sum of True Range over n periods}}{n}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How They Work Together in ADX**\n",
    "- **+DI** and **-DI** indicate the direction of the market (up or down).\n",
    "- The ADX (Average Directional Index) measures the strength of the trend by calculating the absolute difference between +DI and -DI and normalizing it with ATR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components help traders understand both the trend direction and its strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Price Ratio-Based Trend Detection**:\n",
    "   - Short-term average price divided by long-term average price:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Short-Term Average Price}}{\\text{Long-Term Average Price}}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Trading logic:\n",
    "     - Uptrend: Ratio > Threshold (e.g., 1.02).\n",
    "     - Downtrend: Ratio < Threshold (e.g., 0.98).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Load historical price data using the Alpaca Markets API.\n",
    "   - Resample data to desired intervals (e.g., 15 minutes).\n",
    "   - Clean and handle missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Indicator Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Compute short-term and long-term EMAs.\n",
    "   - Calculate ADX and directional indicators.\n",
    "   - Derive the price ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trading Logic**:\n",
    "   - Generate buy/sell signals based on EMA crossovers or price ratio thresholds.\n",
    "   - Combine ADX to filter trades in weak trend conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backtesting**:\n",
    "   - Simulate trades using historical data.\n",
    "   - Account for transaction costs and slippage.\n",
    "   - Evaluate performance metrics:\n",
    "     - Profit/Loss (P&L).\n",
    "     - Sharpe Ratio.\n",
    "     - Maximum Drawdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean-Reversion Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicators Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Z-Score**:\n",
    "   - Measures the deviation of prices from their mean:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Z = \\frac{P_t - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ \\mu $: Rolling mean.\n",
    "     - $ \\sigma $: Rolling standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**:\n",
    "   - Models the mean-reverting behavior of prices:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     dP_t = \\theta (\\mu - P_t) dt + \\sigma dW_t\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Calculate rolling mean and standard deviation for price.\n",
    "   - Compute z-scores of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trading Logic**:\n",
    "   - Buy when $ Z < -2 $.\n",
    "   - Sell when $ Z > 2 $.\n",
    "   - Exit positions when $ |Z| \\leq 1 \\$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtesting**:\n",
    "   - Simulate trades using historical data.\n",
    "   - Measure performance and evaluate robustness under different market regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - **Trend-Following**:\n",
    "     - Effective in trending markets.\n",
    "     - Struggles in sideways markets.\n",
    "   - **Mean-Reversion**:\n",
    "     - Performs well in range-bound conditions.\n",
    "     - Risky during strong trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Profit/Loss (P&L).\n",
    "   - Sharpe Ratio.\n",
    "   - Maximum Drawdown.\n",
    "   - Trade Win Rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Market Regimes**:\n",
    "   - Test strategies under varying market conditions (e.g., high volatility, low liquidity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of trend-following and mean-reversion strategies demonstrates the effectiveness of mathematical indicators in algorithmic trading. While backtesting results are promising, real-world performance requires careful consideration of slippage, transaction costs, and market impact."
