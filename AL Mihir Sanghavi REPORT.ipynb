    "# Algorithmic Trading Strategies: Part I Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on implementing and backtesting two core algorithmic trading strategies using high-frequency data obtained through the Interactive Brokers (IB) API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend-Following Strategy**: Designed to capitalize on sustained market trends.\n",
    "2. **Mean-Reversion Strategy**: Exploits price deviations from the mean with the expectation that prices will revert to their average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation emphasizes utilizing intraday data (e.g., 15-minute intervals), evaluating the mathematical nuances of indicators, and conducting a thorough analysis of strategy performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition via Interactive Brokers API\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these strategies, we retrieve historical market data using the Interactive Brokers API. The IB API provides access to a wide range of financial instruments and supports various data resolutions, making it suitable for high-frequency trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the IB API\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install the IB API**: Ensure that the IB API is installed and properly configured. You can download the API from the [Interactive Brokers website](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Establish a Connection**: Use the `ibapi` Python package to connect to the IB Gateway. Ensure that the IB Gateway is running and configured to accept API connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Request Historical Data**: Utilize the `reqHistoricalData` method to fetch historical market data. Specify the contract details, end date, duration, bar size, and data type as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For detailed instructions on setting up and using the IB API, refer to the [Interactive Brokers API Documentation](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trend-Following Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicators Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:\n",
    "   - The EMA is a weighted average of prices where recent prices are given more weight.\n",
    "   - Formulation:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     EMA_t = \\alpha \\cdot P_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot EMA_{t-1}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ P_t $: Current price\n",
    "     - $ \\alpha $: Smoothing factor, $ \\alpha = \\frac{2}{n + 1} $, and $ n $ is the number of periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Directional Index (ADX)**:\n",
    "   - Measures trend strength and is used to filter weak trends.\n",
    "   - Combines directional indicators $ +DI $ and $ -DI $:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     ADX = 100 \\cdot \\frac{EMA(\\text{True Range})}{\\text{ATR}}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Price Ratio-Based Trend Detection**:\n",
    "   - Short-term average price divided by long-term average price:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Short-Term Average Price}}{\\text{Long-Term Average Price}}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Trading logic:\n",
    "     - Uptrend: Ratio > Threshold (e.g., 1.02).\n",
    "     - Downtrend: Ratio < Threshold (e.g., 0.98).\n",

    "   - Measures the deviation of prices from their mean:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Z = \\frac{P_t - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ \\mu $: Rolling mean.\n",
    "     - $ \\sigma $: Rolling standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process** (Optional):\n",
    "   - Models the mean-reverting behavior of prices:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $\n",
    "     dP_t = \\theta (\\mu - P_t) dt + \\sigma dW_t\n",
    "     $\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of trend-following and mean-reversion strategies demonstrates the effectiveness of mathematical indicators in algorithmic trading. While backtesting results are promising, real-world performance requires careful consideration of slippage, transaction costs, and market impact.\n",
